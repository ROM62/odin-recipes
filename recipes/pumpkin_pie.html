        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Step 1: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 2: To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt in a bowl.
                    Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse
                    crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is
                    mosit enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water
                    if needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 3: Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll
                    dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch.
                    Place a 9-inches pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to
                    cut a circle of dough 1 1/2 inches larger than the pie pan. Remove
                    and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 4: Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling
                    pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing
                    dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute dough
                    around the top edges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 5: To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown
                    sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with
                    an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into prepared crust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 6: Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the
                    filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover
                    the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling
                    cooks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 7: Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before
                    serving.
