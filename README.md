This project is about making a recipe project using basic html. It involve using
everything learned from the odin project foundation HTML course.

For this project, I made recipes webpages for pumpkin pie, carrot cake, and
pudding. All recipes from from Allrecipes, and images are from google images.
The recipes can be access from the index page by linking to their respective
webpages.

Each recpie page has a description, ingredients, steps section, and an image of
the dish.
